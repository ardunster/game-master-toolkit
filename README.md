## Development Practices

This repository was created using Python 3.9.16, and using pipenv to manage packages. It uses Black and isort to standardize formatting and imports, and Flake8 for linting.

To run Black: `pipenv run black`
To run isort: `pipenv run isort`
To run flake8: `pipenv run flake8`
